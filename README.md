# MLST-INGA
A Maximum Leaf Spanning Tree (based on Algorithm of Habibi and McLurkin) implemented for INGA-Wireless Sensor Nodes. Leaves of this tree are allowed to go offline and thus safe energy. Additionally energy aware variations of this algorithm, considering the power state of the nodes. Nodes with low energy are more likely to become leaves.
